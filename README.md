- 👋 Hi, I’m DBA @jamesdlilley
- 💥 I'm interested in creating a system fueled on capitalism 
and greed that ties 100% of payoff and reward directly to giving 
and contributing in such a way that (1:1 ratio of value?) that 
participants tend to be in a race to give and contribute where 
needed most much the same way that most people today tend to be 
in a race to take  and keep and self-promote. Can this behavior 
be flipped on its head? And what's more;  can it be fueled and 
embued with that same insane and powerful drive and ambition as 
the original illness many of us aren't even aware we are all sick 
with? An ironic recipe of Preservation of self with varying 
degrees of delusion of grandeur. Let's find out just how much 
earning potential can be cultivated out-of/into giving potential...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various blockchain and 
distributed/decentralized technologies, along with robotic 
process automation, and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a concept: DLT/Smart 
Contract twin- or multi-chain technology leveraging greed and gain
and taking and indebtedness to/from one another where commonly the 
rich and the wealthy gain even faster,  the poor remain stuck in 
poverty, and no one has any interest in helping anyone else 
unless their paid for it; but what if it were different? What if 
no actually had a set hourly wage or salary but rather earned 
their entire pay scale by giving to others, contributing to 
someone else's projects, teaching someone something useful, and 
not just helping WHERE IT IS NEEDED, but actually basing reward 
and pay off on an equation that takes into consideration just who 
needs exactly what help but how much is needed, where the focus of 
every participant is to seek out those in need, in ways they can 
contribute to someone else's cause and the more meaningful and 
impactful the giving/contributing/sharing/helping/teaching/etc, 
the more valuable. Many many interesting ideas are coming together
that would be nothing short of transformative miracles; refocusing 
Attention and energy and effort on all the things/places/people that 
need it most.
